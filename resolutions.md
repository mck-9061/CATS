# Supported resolutions
CATS supports the following resolutions natively:
- 1920x1080
- 1280x720
- 3440x1440
- 5120x1440
- 3620x2036
- 2560x1600

There is also experimental support for any resolution with these aspect ratios, though some things may not work and haven't been tested:
- 16:9
- 16:10
- 43:18
- 32:9
- 905:509

If you have a supported ultrawide monitor and CATS isn't working, try changing your cursor to "OS Cursor" in the ED graphics settings.<br>

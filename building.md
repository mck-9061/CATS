# Building
If you want to build this yourself for whatever reason, you'll first need to obtain API keys from Frontier.
Once you've got the keys, put them into `MultiCarrierManager/ApiTools/OAuth2.cs.template` and remove the .template.

You'll also need to compile the Python script using the command in `build_TraversalSystem.sh`.

The project can then be built as a regular .NET Framework Windows Forms app.

## Installer
The installer can be built with Inno Setup. Open `setup/setup-script.iss` and compile.
